Hayabusa Challenge

“Hayabusa” ("Peregrine Falcon") was a robotic spacecraft developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to return a sample of material from a small near-Earth asteroid named 25143 Itokawa to Earth for further analysis. Hayabusa was launched on 9 May 2003 and landed on the asteroid in November 2005 and was collecting samples in the form of tiny grains of asteroidal material. Suddenly, all communications with Hayabusa was lost in June 2019 and there is no method to retrieve the latest set of data from the spacecraft without being on sight. Since it is assumed that another asteroid has collided with  25143 Itokawa, Hayabusa must be severely damaged and not functioning. JAXA will launch “Ravana” spacecraft to retrieve the lost data of Hayabusa from 25143 Itokawa.

The competitors are asked to build a robot that will be landed on 25143 Itokawa to find and retrieve the blackbox of Hayabusa, in which the robot should navigate autonomously.
