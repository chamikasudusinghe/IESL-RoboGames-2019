# IESL-RoboGames-2019

School Category - Task Specification

Eligibility

Participants are advised to form a team of up to 5 students. 
Any number of teams from a school can enroll in the competition.
All team members should be students of the same school at the time of their participation in the competition.
Each team should provide valid identification documents from their school on the competition day to prove their eligibility to participate in the competition.
Students who will sit for AL examination in 2019 are eligible to participate.

Challenge - Hayabusa Challenge

“Hayabusa” (Japanese: はやぶさ, "Peregrine Falcon") was a robotic spacecraft developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to return a sample of material from a small near-Earth asteroid named 25143 Itokawa to Earth for further analysis. Hayabusa was launched on 9 May 2003 and rendezvoused with Itokawa in mid-September 2005. After arriving at Itokawa, Hayabusa studied the asteroid's shape, spin, topography, colour, composition, density, and history. In November 2005, it landed on the asteroid and collected samples in the form of tiny grains of asteroidal material. All communications with Hayabusa was lost in June 2019 and there is no method to retrieve the latest set of data from the spacecraft without being on sight. Since it is assumed that another asteroid has collided with  25143 Itokawa, Hayabusa must be severely damaged and not functioning. JAXA will launch “Ravana” spacecraft to retrieve the lost data of Hayabusa from 25143 Itokawa.
The competitors are asked to build a robot that will be landed on 25143 Itokawa to find and retrieve the blackbox of Hayabusa, in which the robot should navigate autonomously.

Robot Specification

Dimensions of the robot must not exceed 25 cm × 20 cm (length × width).
Robot must be completely built by the team itself with their own design ideas.
Robot should have a clearly indicated “ON/OFF” or “START” switch.
Once the robot is switched on, it should be self-navigating. Wireless communication and remote controlled robots are not allowed in the competition (Robot should have the intelligence to navigate without any outside help or command).
No off-the-shelf kits (commercial robot kits) are allowed except processing boards (i.e. Arduino or equivalent, Raspberry Pi, etc.), sensor modules and drive gears. If you have any doubt, contact the organizing team.
After starting an attempt, the only interaction of the participants with the robot should be to stop the robot if necessary.
It is encouraged to have a landing mechanism for the robot, but not compulsory.
Robots should be able to land on the landing zone from a height of 50cm without damaging the platform.
Any robot with the potential threat of damaging the game platform will not be allowed to compete.
Robots should work under any ambient light conditions. Calibration should be done at the start for light conditions if necessary.
There are no height restrictions on the robot.

Task Procedure

After your team name is called for the competition you are allowed to have one test attempt for your robot which is limited to 10 minutes.
After the test attempt you will have 2 more attempts which are used to give you marks. Maximum score of given two attempts will be taken as the score of the current round.
All robots will be collected by the organizers 10 minutes before the round begins. Robots will only be returned to the competitors after the round is completed.
Steps should be followed to complete the task,

Place the robot.
Robot will be placed above the landing zone from a defined height.
Start the robot.
On the command of the supervisor the robot’s ON switch is triggered and it’s put into full autonomous mode.
Land the robot.
Landing should happen in the landing zone marked on the arena.
Locate the statons
Stations are located at the path to navigate towards the blackbox.
Find the blackbox
The blackbox of Hayabusa is placed in the area and the robot should be able to locate it autonomously.
Retrieve the blackbox.
Balckbox can be retrieved using a magnet.
Return to the landing zone.
The robot is expected to find and retrieve the blackbox and then return to the landing zone with the blackbox.
Crossing the boundary line will result in reduction of marks.
Marks will be given to reaching each station.

Timing Measurements

The task will be timed from the time the ON button of the robot is pressed to the time when the robot reaches the landing zone with the blackbox.  
Time taken to complete the task will be considered when giving marks.  
Time taken for the task should be less than 10 minutes and if the robot exceeds the time limit of 10 minutes your robot will be removed from the arena.

Grading Criteria will be released after registration deadline.
